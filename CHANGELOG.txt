Version 0.35 - 20080630

* Automatically re-arrange the atoms so that file can be streamed and start faster (used method from qt-faststart.c, v0.1 by Mike Melanson, melanson@pcisys.net)
* Option -x allows STDOUT streaming during download (see usage)
* All messages now go to STDERR

Version 0.24 - 20080618:

* Detect null Content-Length header upon download - doesn't replace a partially d/loaded file if there is a failure

Version 0.21 - 20080616:
